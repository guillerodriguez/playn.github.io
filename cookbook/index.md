# Cookbook

Here we show "recipes" for doing a bunch of common things with PlayN code. The cookbook is divided
into sections, to keep the pages from growing so large that they crash your browser. One should
hopefully be able to guess which section is likely to contain the recipe they seek and can then
scan the recipes or use their browser's search functionality to dig deeper.

* [Graphics](graphics.html) - using `Image`, `Canvas`, `Texture`, `Surface`, etc.
* [Scene graph](scene-graph.html) - `Layer`-related things
* [Sound](sound.html) - `Sound` and fury
* [Input](input.html) - `Mouse`, `Touch`, `Pointer` and `Keyboard`
* [Net](net.html) - networking for fun and profit
* [Build](build.html) - Maven, IDEs, and other modern torture devices

Each recipe contains just the code snippet that accomplishes the goal in question. An easy way to
play with the snippets is to check out the [Hello] sample game and then paste the snippets into
`HelloGame.java`. Follow the instructions for [building and running] the demos to get yourself set
up with a development environment such that you can run the Hello demo.
