# Cookbook

Here we show "recipes" for doing a bunch of common things with PlayN code. The cookbook is divided
into sections, to keep the pages from growing so large that they crash your browser. One should
hopefully be able to guess which section is likely to contain the recipe they seek and can then
scan the recipes or use their browser's search functionality to dig deeper.
