# Docs

If you're new to PlayN, read the Overview documentation to get an idea of what PlayN is and what
functionality it provides. Then you might like to build and run some [demos](#demos) or jump right
into the [tutorial](tutorial.html) and build a game.

* [Overview](overview.html)
* Javadocs: [core](api/core/),  [scene](api/scene/)
* [Release notes](release/notes.html)
* [Source code](http://github.com/playn/playn)

## Tutorials

Here you can learn how to use PlayN functionality step by step in the process of building a simple
game.

* [Reversi tutorial](reversi-tutorial.html)
* [Space Invaders tutorial](invaders-tutorial.html)

## Demos

We have a few simple demos of PlayN functionality. You can download and build them to ensure that
you have your [development environment](setup.html) set up properly, and they show how to do some
useful things with the library.

* [Hello] - the PlayN equivalent of Hello World
* [Cute] - draws an environment and a character walking around therein
* [Showcase] - shows a bunch of different things, including JBox2D integration
