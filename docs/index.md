# Docs

Various and sundry documentation. If you're new to PlayN, reading the Overview documentation will
give you an idea of what PlayN is and what functionality it provides. Then you might like to build
and run some demos or jump right into a tutorial and build something with it.

## Overview

Read the [overview](overview.html) of the PlayN library, or jump right to a particular section:

* [Graphics](overview.html#graphics)
* [Audio](overview.html#audio)
* [Assets](overview.html.html#assets)
* [Network](overview.html#network)
* [Platforms](overview.html#platform)

## Tutorial

This [tutorial](tutorial.html) describes the process of building a simple Reversi game from scratch
with PlayN. It will assume you've read the overview documentation above to understand the basic
components of PlayN and what they do.

with the library.
