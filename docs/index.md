# Docs

If you're new to PlayN, reading the Overview documentation will give you an idea of what PlayN is
and what functionality it provides. Then you might like to build and run some demos or jump right
into a tutorial and build something with it.

* [Overview](overview.html)
* Javadocs: [core](api/core/),  [scene](api/scene/)
* [Release notes](release_notes.html)
* [Source code](http://github.com/playn/playn)

## Tutorial

This [tutorial](tutorial.html) describes the process of building a simple Reversi game from scratch
with PlayN. It will assume you've read the overview documentation above to understand the basic
components of PlayN and what they do.

* [Development environment](setup.html)
* [Create a skeleton game](tutorial.html#skeleton)
* [Draw the board](tutorial.html#drawing)
* [Handle player input](tutorial.html#input)
* [Make some noise](tutorial.html#audio)

## Demos

We have a few simple demos of PlayN functionality. You can download and build them to ensure that
you have your [development environment](setup.html) set up properly, and they show how to do some
useful things with the library.

* [Hello] - the PlayN equivalent of Hello World
* [Cute] - draws an environment and a character walking around therein
* [Showcase] - shows a bunch of different things, including JBox2D integration
